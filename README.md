# Algorithms and Data Structures
 
This repository contains most of the work I've done during the university Algorithms and data structures course. The subjects covered during the course:
* Sorting algorithms - Merge, quick, hashtable, heap sort
* Data stuctures - stack, queue, heap, AVL trees, hash tables
* Data compression - Huffman's algorithm
* Graph theory - Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal's & Prim's algorithms
